thanks to fishe for these
11. Makes character upside down
"DFIntFreeFallBalanceP": "-9999"
12. Makes character ragdoll forever
"DFIntGettingUpBalanceP": "0"
13. Lags the player
"DFIntS2PhysicsSenderRate": "10000000"
14. Spins character while they are in falling/jumping state
"DFIntFreeFallOrientationP": "-14"
15. Noclip FFlags, require to be used in combo
"FIntPGSPenetrationMarginMax": "2147483647",
"FIntPGSPenetrationMarginMin": "2147483647"
16. Allows you to bounce high from flicks
"DFIntNewRunningBaseAltitudeP": "49534"
17. Character gets into a ragdoll loop (only when you're in a ragdoll state already)
"DFIntGettingUpBalanceD": "-10000"
18. Bounces character constantly at 0. Jump to randomly bounce yourself high or just fall through the map at 500
"DFIntNewRunningBaseAltitudeD": "0"
19. Very limited speed fflag that works only in a few games, one of them being Phantom Forces, and it makes you only slightly faster
"DFIntDebugSimPhysicsSteppingMethodOverride": 10000000
20. Makes it so your gravity is reduced by a factor of Int value you put in when on the ground, weird trigger + very sensitive (2000 makes you fling like 100 studs up everytime u touch the floor) 1500 makes you "hop" very quickly on the ground, if u hold jump sometimes you are able to jump with the gravity reduction meaning a super jump
"DFIntNewRunningBaseGravityReductionFactorHundredth": "1000"
21. Very controllable bounce, only works with negative values, 0 allows you to hover
"DFIntMaxAltitudePDStickHipHeightPercent": "-200"
22. Adds head colission to r15 
"FFlagMeshPartHeadsDefaultIsEnabled": false
23. World speed flag based on player's fps, boosts the physics fps basically
"FFlagDebugSimIntegrationStabilityTesting": "True"
24. noclip, but like complete noclip, you will fall through the floor
"DFIntSHCellMinSizeAsBitShift": "4"
25. Wallglide
"DFFlagUnstickForceAttackInTenths": "-1"

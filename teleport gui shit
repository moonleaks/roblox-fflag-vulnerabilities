FFLAG Name:FFlagCoreScriptShowTeleportPrompt
set it to: true
puporse:so when you get teleported you can put a custom gui 
game:GetService("TeleportService"):SetTeleportGui("whatever gui")
and it will get deleted when teleported but when you use FFlagCoreScriptShowTeleportPrompt
it stays
thanks to producer for the example
